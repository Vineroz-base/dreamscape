# Dreamscape Roguelite

A mobile‑friendly, single‑page HTML roguelite prototype with dark mode UI, swipe/tap controls, shard collection, and persistent progression via localStorage.

---

## 📖 Introduction
Dreamscape Roguelite is a lightweight browser game designed for mobile users. Built entirely in one HTML file, it uses canvas rendering, glowing neon accents, and a centralized dark mode layout to deliver quick runs with long‑term progression. Players dive into surreal dreamscapes, collect shards, and dodge obstacles. Each run contributes to persistent growth, with shard counts saved locally so progress carries over between sessions.
